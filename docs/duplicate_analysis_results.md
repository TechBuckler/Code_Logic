# Duplicate Functionality Analysis

## Summary
After analyzing the codebase, we've identified several areas where functionality is duplicated across multiple files. These represent opportunities for consolidation to improve maintainability.

## Key Duplicated Functionality

### Path Operations
**Recommended consolidation**: `path_utils.py`

Found in 26 files, including:
- `modules/project_organizer_module.py` (15 occurrences)
- `bootstrap.py` (11 occurrences)
- `modules/module_explorer_module.py` (8 occurrences)
- `unified_ui.py` (6 occurrences)

### JSON Operations
**Recommended consolidation**: `json_utils.py`

Found in multiple files, including:
- `core/hierarchical_core.py`
- `core/unified_core.py`

### File Operations
**Recommended consolidation**: `file_utils.py`

Common patterns include:
- File reading/writing functions
- Directory creation and management

### String Processing
**Recommended consolidation**: `string_utils.py`

Common patterns include:
- Text normalization
- String cleaning
- Keyword extraction

## Consolidation Plan

1. Create a `utils` directory with the following helper files:
   - `file_utils.py` - File reading/writing operations
   - `path_utils.py` - Path manipulation and directory handling
   - `json_utils.py` - JSON parsing and serialization
   - `string_utils.py` - String cleaning and normalization
   - `config_utils.py` - Configuration loading and access
   - `logging_utils.py` - Logging setup and management

2. Update imports across the codebase to use these consolidated utilities

3. Remove duplicate implementations from individual files

This consolidation will significantly reduce code duplication while making the codebase more maintainable.
