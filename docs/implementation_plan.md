# Implementation Plan: Codebase Reorganization

## Phase 1: Create Utility Foundation (Week 1)

**Goal**: Establish core utility modules to eliminate the most significant duplication.

1. Create `utils` directory with initial helper files:
   - `path_utils.py` - Path operations (found in 26 files)
   - `file_utils.py` - File reading/writing operations
   - `json_utils.py` - JSON operations
   - `string_utils.py` - String processing

2. Refactor highest-duplication files first:
   - `modules/project_organizer_module.py` (15 path operation occurrences)
   - `bootstrap.py` (11 path operation occurrences)
   - `modules/module_explorer_module.py` (8 path operation occurrences)

3. Create unit tests for utility functions to ensure reliability

## Phase 2: Implement Top-Level Structure (Week 2)

**Goal**: Establish the balanced top-level directory structure.

1. Create the 7 top-level directories:
   ```
   code_logic_tool_full/
   ├── core/         # Core algorithms and processing
   ├── modules/      # Module implementations
   ├── ui/           # User interface components
   ├── utils/        # Utility functions and helpers (already started)
   ├── tools/        # Standalone tools
   ├── docs/         # Documentation
   └── tests/        # Test suite
   ```

2. Move files to appropriate top-level directories:
   - Core algorithms → `core/`
   - Module implementations → `modules/`
   - UI components → `ui/`
   - Standalone tools → `tools/`
   - Documentation → `docs/`
   - Tests → `tests/`

3. Update imports to reflect new structure

## Phase 3: Apply Fractal Organization (Week 3)

**Goal**: Ensure balanced subdirectory structure with 5-20 items per directory.

1. For each top-level directory with more than 20 files:
   - Identify logical groupings
   - Create subdirectories
   - Move files to appropriate subdirectories

2. Implement the balanced structure:
   - `core/` → `ast/`, `ir/`, `proof/`, `optimization/`, `export/`
   - `modules/` → `hierarchical/`, `resource_oriented/`, `standard/`
   - `ui/` → `components/`, `renderers/`, `pages/`
   - `utils/` → `file/`, `nlp/`, `runtime/`, `system/`
   - `tools/` → `shadow_tree/`, `fractal/`, `resource/`, `testing/`

3. Update imports to reflect new subdirectory structure

## Phase 4: Apply Resource-Based Splitting (Week 4)

**Goal**: Categorize components by resource usage for optimal performance.

1. Analyze resource usage patterns:
   - CPU-intensive components
   - Memory-intensive components
   - GPU-intensive components
   - Network-intensive components

2. Create resource-specific implementations:
   - `modules/resource_oriented/cpu/`
   - `modules/resource_oriented/memory/`
   - `modules/resource_oriented/gpu/`
   - `modules/resource_oriented/network/`

3. Implement resource-aware loading mechanism

## Phase 5: Documentation and Finalization (Week 5)

**Goal**: Ensure the reorganized codebase is well-documented and maintainable.

1. Update all documentation to reflect new structure
2. Generate new Shadow Tree for the reorganized codebase
3. Create migration guide for any external dependencies
4. Implement automated tests to verify structure integrity

## Implementation Approach

We'll use an incremental approach:

1. **Start with utilities**: Immediate impact on reducing duplication
2. **Top-level structure next**: Establish the foundation for organization
3. **Fractal organization**: Balance directory sizes
4. **Resource-based splitting**: Optimize for performance
5. **Documentation**: Ensure maintainability

This approach allows us to see benefits at each phase while minimizing disruption.

## Success Metrics

1. No directory contains more than 20 items
2. No directory contains fewer than 5 items (except leaf directories)
3. Maximum directory depth is 5 levels
4. Duplicate code is reduced by at least 70%
5. All imports work correctly after reorganization
6. Shadow Tree navigation works seamlessly with the new structure
