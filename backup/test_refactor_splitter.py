"""
Refactor Splitter

This module breaks down complex Python files and functions into smaller, more manageable components:
- Splits large files into logical modules
- Breaks complex functions into smaller, focused functions
- Extracts common functionality into utility functions
- Maintains imports and dependencies during splitting

This implementation leverages existing file splitting capabilities in the codebase:
- SmartSplitter for resource-oriented splitting with dependency tracking
- FileSplitter for class and function-based splitting

Part of a 3-file refactoring system:
1. refactor_analyzer.py - Analyzes code and identifies refactoring opportunities
2. refactor_splitter.py - Breaks down complex files and functions
3. refactor_builder.py - Rebuilds optimized files from components
